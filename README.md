# CryptoClustering
 
Using knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if crytocurrencies are affected by 24-hour of 7-day price changes.

I will do this by:
- preparing the data using StandScaler module from scikit-learn
- finding the best value for k using the original scaled dataframe
- cluster crytocurrencies with k-means using the original scaled data
- optimize clusters with Principal Component Analysis
- find the best value for k using PCA data
- cluster cryptocurrencies with k-means usign the PCA data
